function BP = CylShearAdj4D(coeff, F)
%CYLSHEARADJ4D performs the 4D cylindrical shearlet synthesis (adjoint).
%   CylShearAdj4D is the function which corresponds to the adjoint. The
%   coefficients coeff are convolved (using FFT) against the respective 
%   dual filters of F over all scales or level 1 <= l <= L. Low frequency
%   coefficients (level L+1) are not affected.
%
%   Since the filters are (approximately) symmetric (at least if they were
%   of odd length) and real-valued, the filters F work as the dual filters.
% 
%   The putput is a Laplacian pyramid bandpass array which can be
%   reconstructed using PyrNDRec.m because the implementation is unitary.
%
% INPUT
%  coeff    : 4D Cylindrical shearlet coefficients organized like F into
%             5D arrays for each level (except for L + 1 which is 4D).
%  f        : 3D Meyer type cylindrical shearlet filters stored in spatial
%             domain and in 4D arrays.
%
% OUTPUT
%  BP       : Spatial 4D bandpass data at predetermined level.
