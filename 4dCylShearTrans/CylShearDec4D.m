function coeff = CylShearDec4D(BP, F)
%CYLSHEARDEC4D performs the 4D cylindrical shearlet decomposition.
%   CylShearDec4D is the function for the corresponding decomposition. The
%   bandpass data BP is decomposed at given level using Meyer filters F
%   organized as in FIndex.
%
%   The actual decomposition is carried out by performing convolutions
%   between BP and F. For computational efficiency this is done using FFT.
%   The FFT is only carried out in 3D (cylindrically).
%
% INPUT
%  BP       : Spatial 4D bandpass data at predetermined level. 
%  F        : 3D Meyer type cylindrical shearlet filters stored in spatial
%             domain and in 4D arrays.
%
% OUTPUT
%  coeff    : 4D Cylindrical shearlet coefficients organized like F into
%             5D arrays for each level (except for level + 1 which is 4D).
