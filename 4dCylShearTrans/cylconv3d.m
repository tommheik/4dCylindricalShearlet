function z = cylconv3d(F, g, outSz)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CYLCONV3D performs a Fourier side cylindrical convolution with respect
% to the first 3 dimensions of F and g.
% 
% Input
%   F       : 3D or 4D array of correct size already in the Fourier domain
%   g       : 3D array of original size in the spatial domain
%   outSz   : Desired size of the output z
%
% Output
%   z       : Convolution of size outSz, real valued 3D or 4D array and 
%             in the spatial domain.
